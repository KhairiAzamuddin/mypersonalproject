I'll share a bit regarding the journey when become a secondary school
student and as an university student. I do choose to apply Maahad
Tahfiz dan Kemukjizatan Al-Qur'an as my secondary because it's near to 
my home only around 15km in between both places so I may not having 
the feeling of <i>homesick</i> when studying there because I choose to 
stay at their provided hostel. I choose to stay in hostel because I 
want learn to become an independent person and son.</p>

<a name="secondary school">This is my secondary school.</a> 

<p style="width:60%" align="justify">The school that I apply on the year of 2013 as a Form 1 student. This school located at Jalan Air Jernih, Kampung Ulu Kenderong, Gerik, Perak which only 15km from my house as stated earlier. I've been experienced a lot when be their student. There were sweet and bitter memories locked there. From a nerd student until I've been awarded as the best academic student there with my PT3 & SPM overall result and received on different year. Start the journey there 2013 until I finished my study on 2017 as a Form 5 student.</p>

<h2>Universiti Teknologi MARA (Kedah)</h2>
<img src="uitmkedah.jpg" width="20%" length="20%" border="3" alt="UiTM Kedah">

<p style="width:60%" align="justify">This is the institution that I apply right after got my SPM Result. I'm fill up the application form online at UPU Portal and I'm being successful accepted by UiTM Kedah to become their student. I choose the course of Information Management for diploma because I've been through course lists and saw only this course is suits with my SPM Result due to I'm not a science stream student. The date I become an university student is 15 July 2018 and currently I'm struggle to complete my final semester which will ends on January 2021. Overall my diploma takes 5 semester which 2 1/2 years. It is quite tough but I need to face it till the end.</p>

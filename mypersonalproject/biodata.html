As for introduction, the name that has been given to me by my parents is <b>Khairi Azamuddin</b>.
It's just a simple name for because of its 2 sentences compared to my friends that have 3 sentences
of name even 4. The name given also has a good meaning which my names means a person that charitable and always have a goals and dream. I was born on <a href="galleries.html">18th December 2000</a> which the day is monday on that year at 8.46 p.m. I borned in <a href="galleries.html">Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun</a> located at Ipoh, Perak or some citizens there familiar with <i>"Hospital Besar Ipoh"</i> in Malay. This hospital such a pleasure place because of their services in accordance with their vision:

I was born at Ipoh, Perak but I'm growed up at my current and beloved hometown which was Gerik, Perak that around 129km in between both places. This town does not big as other town but still I considered it the best town because of it's village atmosphere.<a href="galleries.html">Gerik</a> is a town that suburbs. We're here does not have any shopping complex or mall, grand cinema hall, train facilities, grand restaurant which makes us a bit harder if intended to enjoy any entertainment and another accomodation. Folks here also do not being outside as they please due to people here only went out for work and went home when work is done. Some outsider does not familiar this town with the name of "Gerik". Most of them knew this town as <a href="galleries.html" style="color:magenta">Hulu Perak</a>

Mobile games mentioned were Mobile Legends:Bang Bang and Call of Duty Mobile. I willing to spent hours for playing them and that's my hobby ;)</p>
